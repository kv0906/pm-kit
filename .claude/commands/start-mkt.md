## The Compounding Marketing Philosophy

Unlike traditional marketing tools that require the same effort every time, PM-Kit marketing plugins implement **compounding intelligence**:

**Campaign 1 (40 hours):**

Each campaign makes the next one easier through accumulated patterns, templates, and knowledge.

## Getting Started

### Step 1: Explore Your Workspace

Check out your marketing workspace:
```
exercises/markit/
├── campaigns/          # Campaign briefs (created by /cm:plan)
├── content/           # Generated content (created by /cf:generate)
│   ├── blog/
│   ├── email/
│   ├── social/
│   └── ads/
├── brand/             # Brand guidelines and personas
├── research/          # Competitive analysis
├── analytics/         # Performance data, pattern library
└── templates/         # Reusable templates (compounding!)
```

### Step 2: Create Your First Campaign Brief

The CM (Compounding Marketing) plugin plans campaigns with intelligence:

```bash
/cm:plan "Q1 Product Launch" --budget 50000 --duration "6 weeks"
```

This will:
- ✅ Research similar past campaigns (compounding effect!)
- ✅ Analyze target audience and competitors
- ✅ Generate comprehensive 12-section brief
- ✅ Create execution checklist
- ✅ Save structured plan to campaigns/

### Step 3: Generate Content at Scale

The CF (Content Factory) plugin creates content in parallel:

```bash
/cf:generate "Q1 Product Launch" --formats "blog,email,social" --quantity "3 blogs, 5 emails, 20 social"
```

This will:
- ✅ Create 28 pieces of content simultaneously
- ✅ Validate brand voice consistency
- ✅ Optimize for SEO and conversion
- ✅ Organize in structured folders
- ✅ Generate content calendar

### Step 4: Review with Specialized Agents

Get multi-perspective feedback:

```bash
@brand-voice-guardian Review this blog post for brand consistency
@seo-specialist Optimize this for "team productivity software"
@conversion-optimizer Improve conversion on this landing page
@startup-sam-reviewer Does this resonate with founders?
```
