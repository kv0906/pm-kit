## Brand Voice (for Planerio content)

- **Tone:** Professional but approachable
- **Style:** Knowledgeable without being condescending
- **Perspective:** Use "we" and "you"
- **Focus:** Benefits before features
- **Avoid:** Hyperbole, jargon, passive voice

## Course Philosophy

**The Compounding Effect:** Each campaign makes the next one easier through accumulated templates, patterns, and knowledge.

- Campaign 1: Build foundation (40 hours)
- Campaign 5: Leverage patterns (15 hours) 
- Campaign 10: Systematized workflow (10 hours)

This is the opposite of traditional tools that require the same effort every time.
