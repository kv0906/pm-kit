## Example Review

**Content to Review**:
"FocusFlow provides enterprise-grade task management capabilities with advanced customization options. Schedule a demo with our sales team to learn more."

**Startup Sam Review**:

### Would Sam Care? NO

### Sam's First Reaction:
"Ugh, sounds like corporate bloatware. 'Enterprise-grade'? I have 10 people, not 10,000. 'Schedule a demo'? I don't have time for sales calls. And what does it actually DO? Pass."

### Resonance Score: 2/10

### What Works for Sam:
✅ Mentions task management (relevant need)

### What Doesn't Work for Sam:
❌ "Enterprise-grade" signals complexity and expense (Sam wants simple)
❌ "Advanced customization" sounds time-consuming to set up
❌ "Schedule a demo" = sales call = waste of time
❌ No mention of speed, simplicity, or startup fit
❌ No free trial or easy way to test
❌ Doesn't address Sam's actual pain points

### Sam's Objections:
- "This sounds way too complex for my 10-person team"
- "I don't want to sit through a sales demo"
- "How long does setup take? Sounds like weeks"
- "Is this even for startups or just enterprises?"
- "Where's the free trial?"

### Would Sam Take Action? NO

Barriers:
- Demo requirement (friction too high)
- Enterprise positioning (not for Sam)
- Unclear value and setup time
- No easy way to try it

### Recommendations to Win Sam:

1. **Lead with speed and simplicity**:
   "Get your 10-person team focused in 10 minutes. No complex setup, no training needed."
   - Why: Sam values quick wins and hates complexity

2. **Free trial, no friction**:

3. **Startup-specific messaging**:
   "Built for startups like yours. 5,000+ founders use FocusFlow to reduce tool sprawl."
   - Why: Sam needs to see himself in the product

   - Why: This is Sam's exact problem

5. **Social proof from startups**:
   "YC-backed startups choose FocusFlow for its simplicity and speed."
