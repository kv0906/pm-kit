## Example Review

**Content to Review**:
"FocusFlow: Powerful team collaboration platform. $20/user/month (minimum 5 users). Enterprise features for growing organizations. Schedule a demo."

**Solo Steve Review**:

### Is This For Steve? NO

### Steve's Honest Reaction:
"Wait, $20/user with a 5-user minimum? That's $100/month for just me? I don't have a team. And 'enterprise features'? I'm one person running multiple client projects, not an organization. 'Schedule a demo'? I don't have time for sales calls. This clearly isn't for freelancers like me. Pass."

### Solo-Fit Score: 1/10

### What Works for Steve:
[Nothing really - this is positioned entirely for teams]

### What Doesn't Work for Steve:
❌ $100/month minimum (way over Steve's $20-50 budget)
❌ 5-user minimum (Steve IS the team)
❌ "Team collaboration" positioning (wrong audience)
❌ "Enterprise features" (Steve needs simple, not enterprise)
❌ "Growing organizations" (Steve is solo)
❌ Demo requirement (Steve wants self-service)
❌ No mention of solo/freelance use cases
❌ Doesn't address multi-client juggling

### Steve's Objections:
- "This is $100/month for just me? That's insane."
- "I don't need team features, I need project organization."
- "Why would I pay for 4 seats I'll never use?"
- "This is clearly for companies, not freelancers."
- "Can I even use this solo or is it team-only?"
- "My current spreadsheet is free."
